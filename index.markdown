## Welcome to my page!

### About me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow under Prof. Meng Li at Bauer Human-Centered AI Institute, University of Houston. I received my Ph. D. in Economics from the Department of Economics of the University of Southern California.

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data-driven optimization, exploring how these technologies are transforming business operations and decision-making processes. I focus on applying AI/ML to enhance efficiency and strategic outcomes in areas like supply chains, multi-sided platforms, and digital ecosystems. By leveraging reinforcement learning, deep learning algorithms, and quantitative modeling, I aim to uncover new market dynamics and provide insights into the effective integration of AI/ML technologies in business contexts, ensuring alignment with human-centered objectives and ethical considerations.
